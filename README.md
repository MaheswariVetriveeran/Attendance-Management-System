# Attendance-Management-System
This project is an automated Attendance Management System using Face Recognition. The system provides an easy-to-use interface built with Tkinter for capturing student details and faces. Using OpenCV and LBPH face recognition, the system automatically recognizes students' faces during class and tracks their attendance in real-time.
